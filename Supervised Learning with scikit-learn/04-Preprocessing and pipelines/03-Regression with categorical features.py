Regression with categorical features
Having created the dummy variables from the 'Region' feature, you can build regression models as you did before. Here, you'll use ridge regression to perform 5-fold cross-validation.

The feature array X and target variable array y have been pre-loaded.

Instructions
100 XP
Import Ridge from sklearn.linear_model and cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.
Instantiate a ridge regressor called ridge with alpha=0.5 and normalize=True.
Perform 5-fold cross-validation on X and y using the cross_val_score() function.
Print the cross-validated scores.

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Instantiate a ridge regressor: ridge
ridge = Ridge(alpha=.5,normalize=True)

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation: ridge_cv
ridge_cv = cross_val_score(ridge,X,y,cv=5)

# Print the cross-validated scores
print(ridge_cv)
